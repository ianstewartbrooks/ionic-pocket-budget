# Ionic Pocket Budget

Pocket Budget is my first major Ionic app and I will be revising it over time with new features and coding techniques I've learnt.

It's an income and expenditure tracker that is designed to be easily visible by visually impaired people. The chosen colours are also good for thsoe with dyslexia.

The app stores any data entered on the device itself rather than storing it in the cloud.

I will be releasing the app on Google Play and iOS App Store at some point in the future.

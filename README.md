# Ionic Pocket Budget

Pocket Budget is my first major Ionic app and I will be revising it over time with new features and coding techniques I've learnt.

It's a income and expenditure tracker that is designed to be easily visable for those with visually impaired people. The chosen colours are good for thsoe with dyslexia.

I will be releasing the app on Google Play and iOS App Store at some point in the future.
